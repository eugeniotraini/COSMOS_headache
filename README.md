Script for headache analysis in COSMOS NL &amp; UK

Headache is a highly prevalent and important disabling condition. Questions have been raised about a possible link between long-term mobile phone use and headache. We conducted a prospective cohort study (N=78,437) to explore the association between mobile phone use (calling, texting) at baseline and the occurrence of (weekly, severe weekly, and daily) headache at 4-year follow-up.
